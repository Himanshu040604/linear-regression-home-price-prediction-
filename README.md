# linear-regression-home-price-prediction-
This model predicts housing prices based on the area of properties using a simple linear regression approach implemented from scratch in Python. 

The dataset used contains pairs of area and corresponding price values. The model starts by randomly initializing parameters (slope and intercept), then iteratively adjusts them using gradient descent to minimize the mean squared error loss between predicted and actual prices.

During training, the model visualizes the original data points and its predictions, providing insights into how it learns to approximate the relationship between area and price. This project serves as a foundational exercise in understanding linear regression and its application in predicting real-world values based on input features.
